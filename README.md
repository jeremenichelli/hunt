# hunt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeremenichelli/hunt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jeremenichelli/hunt)

Light-weight library to observe nodes entering and leaving the viewport.


## Install

Download the library and include it in a script tag or install as a package.

```sh
npm install huntjs --save
```


## Usage and basic config

Create an obsever passing an element or a collection of them and an **options** object.

In most cases you might just want to observe a collection of nodes and do something with them when they enter the screen. For this you will only need to pass a node or a node list, and an object with an `enter` callback.

```js
import Hunt from 'huntjs';

const lazyImages = document.querySelectorAll('.lazy__images');

let observer = new Hunt(lazyImages, {
  enter: (image) => image.src = image.dataset.src
});
```

**hunt** also tracks when elements leave the screen, you can pass a `leave` callback to the configuration object to do something when this happens.

```js
import Hunt from 'huntjs';

const someElements = document.querySelectorAll('.some__elements');

let observer = new Hunt(someElements, {
  leave: (element) => element.classList.remove('visible')
});
```

_Both callbacks will receive the element which triggered the action as argument._

After an element has entered and left the viewport, **hunt** will stop tracking its position and after all the observed elements have left the observer will get _disconnected_ to prevent unnecessary computation on the scroll event.

If you want to track the elements all the time you can use the `persist` option.

```js
import Hunt from 'huntjs';

const someElements = document.querySelectorAll('.some__elements');

let observer = new Hunt(someElements, {
  enter: (element) => element.classList.add('visible'),
  leave: (element) => element.classList.remove('visible'),
  persist: true
});
```


### All the options

**hunt** observers also accept other configurations that are rarely necessary but might become handy for your use case, heare are all listed:

 - `enter` **(function)** method that will be called when the element becomes visible.

 - `leave` **(function)** method that will be called when the element disappears from the viewport.

 - `persist` **(boolean)** once the element has entered and left the viewport, the observer stops _hunting_ it unless you set this option to `true`, once it's true, `enter` and `leave` methods awill be called each time an element state changes.

 - `offset` **(number)**, `enter` and `leave` methods will be called a number of pixels ahead of the element's state change, `0` being the default value.

 - `throttleInterval` **(number)** interval that _hunt_ events are throttled by in milliseconds. A lower number will mean elements are detected in view quicker, but may degrade performace. A higher value will mean elements are detected in view slower, but may improve performance. The default value is `100ms`. _We recommend not to modify this variable unless it is extremely necessary._


## Workflow and additional API

Each observer you create will _hunt_ for elements and fire the `enter` function when they appear and the `leave` function when elements have appeared and then disappeared from the viewport.

After both functions are called the observer will stop tracking the element's position unless the `persist` option is set to `true` or the `data-hunt-persist` is set to `"true"`.

You can always call `observer.disconnect()` at any time to stop all activity. Running an isolated check is also possible by calling `observer.trigger()`.


## Custom configuration over dataset

If you have exceptions for one or more elements, `data-hunt-offset` and `data-hunt-persist` attributes can be used. These custom values will override the ones you passed when creating the observer.

```html
<div class="some__element" data-hunt-persist="true" data-hunt-offset="500"></div>
```

These custom values will override the ones you passed when creating the observer.
